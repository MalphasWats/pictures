It had been a long day for Colm. He had driven his train through wind, rain and sun but 
now, finally, he had reached his journey's end.

He hopped down from the cab of the still gleaming engine and walked across the platform. 
He could just see the number 157 bus coming down the hill and if he hurried he could 
catch it and get home before Emma.
